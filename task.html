                    EU CYBER AGENCY SAYS AIRPORT SOFTWARE HELD TO RANSOM BY CRIMINALS

            A ransomware attack has disrupted airports globally, particularly in Europe, affecting systems used for automatic check-in and boarding. The attack targeted software from Collins Aerospace, causing delays and cancellations at major airports like Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. Criminal gangs are suspected, as they often demand ransom in bitcoin to restore systems. While Heathrow and other airports are using manual workarounds, recovery remains ongoing, with some flights resuming on backup systems.

            Collins Aerospace has confirmed the attack, but details on resolution times are unclear. Over 1,000 computers may have been affected, with much of the recovery being done in person. This incident highlights the growing threat of cyberattacks in the aviation sector, which has seen a 600% rise in attacks over the past year. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre is working with law enforcement and affected parties to address the issue.
